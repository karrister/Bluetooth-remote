Bluetooth-remote
=============

A project to make a simple multi-purpose Bluetooth remote controller device.


Currently there are two purposes for this project - one is to serve as a Bluetooth shutter for my Nikon SLR, and the second is to integrate the Bluetooth remote to work with my other project, the StigaGoalSong, to be able to control with over the Bluetooth, when a team scores in the game of table hockey (please take a look at my other project in github, StigaGoalSong).

This repository will have one common PCB design for both purposes, and it will also end up including the PIC FW for both cases (unless I will be able to pack both features in one FW).
